    "HackerLand University has the following grading policy:\n",
    "* Every studen receives a *grade* in the inclusive range from $0$ to $100$.\n",
    "* Any *grade* less than $40$ is a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's *grade* according to these rules:\n",
    "* If the difference between the *grade* and the next multiple of $5$ is less than $3$, round *grade* up to the next multiple of $5$.\n",
    "* If the value of *grade* is less than $38$, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $grade = 84$ will be rounded to $85$ but $grade = 29$ will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than $40$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the initial value of *grade* for each of Sam's $n$ students, write code to automate the rounding process. Complete the function `solve` that takes an integer array of all grades, and return an integer array consisting of the rounded grades. For each $grade_i$, round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.\n",
